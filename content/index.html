Engage when the shit has massively hit the fan. When the problem is "below the waterline", all 
hands on deck kind of situation.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Rule 1:</strong> Identify the absolute minimum needed to solve the problem at hand and do it in the 
shortest possible timeframe, nothing else matters.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Rule 2:</strong> Thats it there is no more.
